[Link within welcome email](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/profile) leads to rejection:  
"Thank you for joining. You don't current qualify for a Microsoft 365 Developer Program sandbox subscription."

Tried again a few days later, still the same.

Ben says we might need to have an Enterprise/Professional version of Visual Studio to do so. Is there a free version that would give us 90 days in the sandbox?
